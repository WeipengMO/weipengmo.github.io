Here, we developed a Nanopore-based long-read method STAM-seq (Single-molecule Targeted Accessibility and Methylation Sequencing) to specifically enrich and examine the epigenetic status of HRRs in Arabidopsis. Our single-molecule long-read analysis revealed that centromeres exhibit either accessible or inaccessible bipolar status; DNA methylation level of each individual rDNA unit is strongly anti-correlated with its accessibility in different variant groups; and telomere length is associated with subtelomeric DNA methylation. STAM-seq can be applied to study the accessibility and methylation of repetitive or high-copy sequences in a wide range of plant species.","tags":null,"title":"Single-molecule Targeted Accessibility and Methylation Sequencing of Centromeres, Telomeres, and rDNAs in Arabidopsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinbu Jia","Wenqin Lu","Bo Liu","Huihui Fang","Yiming Yu","Weipeng Mo","Hong Zhang","Xianhao Jin","Yi Shu","Yanping Long","Yanxi Pei","Jixian Zhai"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1660838189,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660838189,"objectID":"35c6f7453b62c48747c076b78cf8c6b4","permalink":"https://weipengmo.github.io/publication/jia2022atlas/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T23:56:29+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jia2022atlas/","section":"publication","summary":"Poly(A) tail is a hallmark of eukaryotic messenger RNA and its length plays an essential role in regulating mRNA metabolism. However, a comprehensive resource for plant poly(A) tail length has yet to be established. Here, we applied a poly(A)-enrichment-free, nanopore-based method to profile full-length RNA with poly(A) tail information in plants. Our atlas contains over 120‚Äâmillion polyadenylated mRNA molecules from seven different tissues of Arabidopsis, as well as the shoot tissue of maize, soybean and rice. In most tissues, the size of plant poly(A) tails shows peaks at approximately 20 and 45 nucleotides, while the poly(A) tails in pollen exhibit a distinct pattern with strong peaks centred at 55 and 80 nucleotides. Moreover, poly(A) tail length is regulated in a gene-specific manner‚ÄîmRNAs with short half-lives in general have long poly(A) tails, while mRNAs with long half-lives are featured with relatively short poly(A) tails that peak at ~45 nucleotides. Across species, poly(A) tails in the nucleus are almost twice as long as in the cytoplasm.

Our data reveal a wide range of termination windows among genes, ranging from ~‚Äâ50‚Äânt to over 1000‚Äânt.

With the cost of much less than that of single read of Sanger sequencing, HITAC-seq can generate high-quality contiguous sequences of up to 10 kilobases or longer. The capability of HITAC-seq was confirmed through large-scale sequencing of thousands of plasmid clones and hundreds of amplicon fragments using approximately 100‚ÄØpg of input DNAs. Due to its long synthetic length, HITAC-seq was effective in detecting relatively large structural variations, as demonstrated by the identification of a ‚àº1.3‚ÄØkb Copia retrotransposon insertion in the upstream of a likely maize domestication gene.

We recently developed a full-length nascent RNA sequencing method in the model plant Arabidopsis that simultaneously detects RNA polymerase II position, splicing status, polyadenylation site and poly(A) tail length at genome-wide scale. This method allows calculation of the kinetics of cotranscriptional splicing and detects polyadenylated transcripts with unspliced introns retained at specific positions posttranscriptionally. Here we describe a detailed protocol for this method called FLEP-seq (full-length elongating and polyadenylated RNA sequencing) that is applicable to plants. Library production requires as little as one nanogram of nascent RNA (after rRNA/tRNA removal), and either Nanopore or PacBio platforms can be used for sequencing. We also provide a complete bioinformatic pipeline from raw data processing to downstream analysis. The minimum time required for FLEP-seq, including RNA extraction and library preparation, is 36 h. The subsequent long-read sequencing and initial data analysis ranges between 31 and 40 h, depending on the sequencing platform.","tags":[],"title":"FLEP-seq: simultaneous detection of RNA polymerase II position, splicing status, polyadenylation site and poly (A) tail length at genome-wide scale by single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jixian Zhai","Lidan Xiao","Yanping Long","Weipeng Mo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1626884984,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626884984,"objectID":"7d292bb1073d7591c93b0cf8adbdc455","permalink":"https://weipengmo.github.io/publication/patents/","publishdate":"2021-07-22T00:29:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/patents/","section":"publication","summary":"A gel bead having a code, a preparation method therefor, and an application thereof.
